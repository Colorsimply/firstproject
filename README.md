## Colorsimply 

### App Description
  Lets you know the average color of a photo that you take and outputs through RGB. You can also turn it into a game mode where you are given an RGB value and you take pictures until you get within a certain interval of the RGB value. Also includes a competitive game mode where you can link over wifi and bluetooth with a friend and see who can get the closest to the given color.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: Mobile is essential for this app because you need a camera and a processor to determine RGB values and to link players over bluetooth or wifi.
- Story: Have you ever felt bored with a friend, wondered whether your eye was accurate at detecting colors, or just wondered what color you were staring at? This app solves all those problems!
- Market: People of all ages can learn about RGB colors better, caters to beginners and advanced levels. Can be used for eye tests to find the dominant color in the picture.
- Habit:Very versatile app and can be adapted to check the health of the users eyes. Can also be used for learning and gaming purpose. So depends on the person.
- Scope:The app is relatively basic. It only depends on a camera input and computation by the phone's ALU. We can implement a watered-down version pretty easily, and develop more advanced features if time permits.
